# 2024, γ-Ga₂O₃ Phase Transition

This repository contains the code and data for the study titled **"Revealing the Transformation Pathway of the β to γ Phase Transition in Ga₂O₃: A First-Principles Study."**

## Repository Contents

1. **Generation and Relaxation of γ-Ga₂O₃ Structures:**
   - Utilizes M3GNet to generate and relax various potential γ-Ga₂O₃ structures based on spinel Mg(GaO₂)₂.

2. **Simulated Annealing for Minimum Energy Pathways (MEPs):**
   - Simulated annealing methods are used to identify the MEPs for the β to γ phase transition.

3. **Structural Deviation Analysis:**
   - Analyzes how far the relaxed structures deviate from ideal cubic geometry.
